# Concept
Fury Road is a fast-paced endless runner set in a grimy, post-collapse wasteland. The player takes control of a scrappy, hand-animated goblin sprinting down an unstable, debris-littered road. <br>
The goal: stay alive, dodge hazards, and collect Shiny Bits to grow your fame and extend your run.

## Gameplay
- The goblin runs forward automatically in a three-lane layout.
- The player collects Shiny Bits, a goblin currency that:
  - Increases the score
  - Extends the countdown timer â€” goblins get a "greed rush" when they collect
- Occasional Mushrooms appear:
  - Provide a temporary speed boost and regenerate health
- Hazards/Obstacles reduce health or slow the player. 
- When timer or HP runs out: game over.
